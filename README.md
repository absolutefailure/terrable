# Terrable - A 2D Sandbox Game
>Created using <a href=https://libgdx.com/dev/>libGDX</a> - a cross-platform Java game development framework based on OpenGL (ES).

Terrable is a 2D game inspired by popular sandbox games like Minecraft and Terraria. It is an impressive indie game that manages to combine the best elements of sandbox games with its own unique twist. In this game, the player is thrown into a randomly generated world with four biomes - forest, sea, mountain, and desert - and given the ultimate goal of building a rocketship and flying into space. Its open-world and random generation features allow for endless hours of exploration and discovery. With the upcoming expansion of the game's objective, Terrable will continue to provide a unique and exciting experience for players.

## Gameplay
At the start of the game, the player is left to their own devices with no clear tutorial on where to go or what to do. The game encourages players to figure things out for themselves. To start off, the player must hunt for food and craft basic tools to dig and gather resources. The recipe book provides a guide for crafting items, but the player will have to experiment and discover recipes on their own.

Players can explore and build in the vast world of Terrable. The biomes vary in their resources and challenges, making it necessary to adapt to each one. The player can dig underground to find rare minerals, build a house to keep safe from enemies, and craft tools to defend themselves. The game rewards players for exploring and discovering new things by opening new pages into the recipebook.

## Objective
The current objective of the game is to build a rocketship and fly into space. To achieve this, the player must gather resources, craft necessary materials, and build the rocket. However, in future versions of the game (<a href=https://github.com/absolutefailure/terrable/issues>check issues page for further development ideas</a>), the objective will be expanded to reach other planets and explore new resources. Players will have to gather resources and craft new technologies to build spacecraft capable of interstellar travel. This new objective will add a whole new layer of depth to the game, making it more challenging and engaging.
